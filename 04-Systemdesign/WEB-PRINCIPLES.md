WEB PRINCIPLES THAT WE FEEL SHOULD STILL BE REMEMBERED / FOLLOWED
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1) There is ONLY ONE type of event in any web application.  
    A HTTP request.

2) Every View (web fragment) ONLY has ONE parent.  
    Semantics are inferred in both page markup  
     and overall site structure.

3) Once created, a resource's address SHOULD rarely be abandoned.

4) Every unique resource should have A unique address
  - Do not break the back button
  - Frames are bad
  - AJAX used to load primary content is bad

5) Authorisation (login), is NOT a resource.  
    And therefore should NOT have its own address

6) Functional Enhancements (Javascript) are LAST element  
   in the front end technology stack, NOT the FIRST.  
    Preceded firstly by Markup (HTML) and then Style (CSS)

---------------------------------------------------------

There are three types of semantics to consider within the
world wide web:  
Hierarchical, Ordered and Networked.

- Hierarchical:
  - Page Markup
  - Site url structure (site maps)
- Order:
  - Order from top to bottom within any Hierarchy
  - Page content (first sibling - last sibling)
  - Google search results
- Networked:
  - HyperLinks from one resource to another
   (particularly between different sites)
